# 🌾 Crop Production Analysis
## 📌 Project Overview

This project explores crop production data to uncover insights on crop diversity, efficiency, seasonal variations, and regional contributions. Using Power BI, I built an interactive dashboard that visualizes production patterns across years, crops, and states, helping stakeholders make data-driven agricultural decisions.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Measure crop diversity index and track changes over time.
- Calculate crop efficiency to identify productivity levels.
- Identify top crops, states, and districts by production.
- Compare production across agricultural seasons (Kharif, Rabi, Summer, Winter, Whole Year).
- Provide an interactive view of historical and regional production trends.

## 📊 Key Metrics

- Crop Diversity Index: 124
- Crop Efficiency: 44.01
- Top Crop: Coconut
- Top Producing State: Kerala
- Total Production by Area: 7.56M (Goal: 6.80M, +11.11%)
- Average Production (Assam): 88.21% share in some categories
- Top 10 Districts: Thrissur, Thiruvananthapuram, Palakkad, Malappuram, Kozhikode, and others
- Top Years: 2011, 2013, 2014 among the highest production years

## 🛠️ Tools & Skills Used
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data Visualization
- Agricultural skills

## Power BI – dashboard creation & visualization

- DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – calculated measures for efficiency & trends
-Data Cleaning & Transformation – prepared raw production data for analysis
-Geospatial Mapping – visualized crop production by state & district

## 🚀 Outcome
The final dashboard provides a holistic view of crop production by highlighting:
The most productive crops and regions
Seasonal performance trends across years
Top-performing districts and states
Opportunities for improving agricultural efficiency

**This analysis can support policy makers, agricultural planners, and researchers in making informed decisions on resource allocation, crop planning, and food security strategies.**
