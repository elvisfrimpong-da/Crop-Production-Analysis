# Crop-Production-Analysis
This project analyzes crop production data to uncover insights about crop diversity, efficiency, seasonal variations, and regional contributions. The analysis was carried out in Power BI, resulting in an interactive dashboard that helps identify top-performing crops, states, and districts, as well as trends across years and seasons.
